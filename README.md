# alu_regex-data-extraction-ksheilla-
I have designed an API that aggregates data from all over the web and displays relevant information based on the user's request. Here is the list of data types that need to be extracted from hundreds of pages of strings: 

Email addresses
URLs
Phone numbers
Credit card numbers
Time in 12-hour or 24-hour format
HTML tags
Hashtags
Currency amounts
Using the concept of regular expressions i'm already aware of the specific type of data that i'm searching for in the string and now i'm going to extract those type of data.
